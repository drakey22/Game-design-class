I think of usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi setting, character progression through classes, gear, and skill trees.
My favorite RPG is the mass effect series.
I play RPGs for both gameplay and story.
I read choose your own adventure books if that counts, otherwise this is my first.
Zork reminded me of dungeons and dragons.
The lack of a map and visuals were frustrating, I got lost a lot.
I dont think I found any trophies.
It would be much easier if not text based.
